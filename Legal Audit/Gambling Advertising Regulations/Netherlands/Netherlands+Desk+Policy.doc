<li>
<p>Include the minimum age for participation in a game of chance, in a mann=

<p>Keep players away from any illegal offerings.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Advertise in a responsible and balanced manner.</p></li>

<p>When assessing whether advertising is aimed at vulnerable groups, take i=

 group. Please refer to the <a class=3D"external-link" data-card-appearance=

<li>
<p>Retain proof of best efforts to prevent advertising from reaching vulner=
able groups (eg. monitoring results of advertising activities, intervene or=
 report to operators where necessary). This will show that the company is i=
mplementing best efforts with taking precautions to prevent the targeting o=
f vulnerable groups.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Use age filters for messages on any (social) media channel used, to ensu=
re vulnerable groups are not targeted.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Use closed groups with, for example, an age limited on the (social) medi=
a channel used, to ensure vulnerable groups are not targeted.</p></li>

<p>Reserve advertisements in terms of form, target group, content, purport,=
 number and type of channels where advertisements are offered.</p></li>

<p>Inform players fully and adequately with respect to participation in gam=

<ul>

<p>Keep any advertisements for video games, and games of chance, entirely s=

<p>Clearly distinguish between =E2=80=9Cgames=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cgames o=

<p>Use highly persuasive advertising for high risk games Eg. through banner=

<li>
<p>Use misleading advertising regarding, among other things:</p>

<p>the chance of winning</p></li>
<li>
<p>the characteristics of games of chance</p></li>
<li>
<p>the commitment of the participants</p></li>

<p>the benefits to participants.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p>Present an unrealistic or incorrect picture of a product or service.</p>=
</li>
<li>
<p>Attach conditions to the free participation in a game of chance.</p></li=
>
<li>
<p>Give the impression that the regulator has approved the specific adverti=
sing activities or the games of chance, other than through a neutral statem=
ent that a licence holder has a licence pursuant to the Betting and Gamblin=
g Act.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Give the impression that the licence holder holds a European licence or =
falls under European supervision.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Create the impression that a player can exercise a dominant influence on=
 the outcomes of a game of chance or their winnings.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Use personal data processed in connection with other promotions.</p></li=
>
<li>
<p>Combine advertising with statements about addiction prevention.</p></li>

<p>Aim advertising at players looking for information on facilities relatin=
g to gambling addictions.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Advertise during sporting events and horse races if such advertising is =
directed at spectators or viewers of such activities.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Allow advertising for any goods or services, other than licensed games o=
f chance of the respective operator we are working with.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Advertise alongside any information provided to players about limits.</p=

<li>
<p>Extend advertising to sideline activities (eg. it is not permitted to ma=

<li>
<p>Advertise for or within video games or on websites or applications where=
 video games are on offer.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Aim and specify advertising at persons watching a sporting contest durin=
g such contest (this includes the period after the start and before the end=
 of the contest, and also includes the interval/half-time). An <strong>exce=
ption</strong> to this is where licence holders organize betting on a speci=
fic contest and show the progress of that contest.<strong> </strong>This al=
so does preclude the general promotion of live betting that does not relate=
 to a specific sporting event and the promotion of listings at a specific s=
porting event prior to that event.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Advertise bonuses linked to taking part a certain number of times in a g=
ame of chance. Bonuses linked to taking part a certain number of times in a=
 game of chance, or advertising aimed at exerting social pressure in a high=
-risk game, are examples of irresponsible advertising activities aimed at e=
ncouraging players to continue playing.</p></li>

<p>*The following individuals/careers are defined as Role models;</p>

b. persons who visibly perform or depict an office or profession that serve=

The explanatory notes to the amendment explain that social role models are =
for example doctors, police officers or teachers.<br>
We note that the prohibition makes no distinction to the content of recruit=
ment or advertising activities involving the use of role models, including =
pictures of role models. License holders also not use role models in advert=
ising to raise awareness for the risks of participating in risky games of c=
hance. Land based providers of games of chance may, however, use role model=
s on location or in advertisements if it does not relate to online games of=
 chance, for example using a famous cook in the restaurant or promoting the=
 performance of a singer on location.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Summary </em>of the Decree on untargeted advertising of online games=
 of chance):</p>
<ol start=3D"1">
<li>
<p>No advertsing activities through broadcasting media, printed media or pu=
blic places (does not prohibit internet advertising)</p></li>

ose reached by advertising activity had reached the age of 24</strong></p><=
/li>
<li>
<p>Enter into force on the <strong>1st July 2023.</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Important considerations:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If one cannot show that 95% of those visiting a website are over the age=
 of 24-<strong> no advertising of online games of chance is allowed on thos=
e websites</strong>. Google Analytics can be used for this purpose</p></li>
<li>
<p>In account based environments we must ensure<strong> opt out options and=
 age verification measures</strong></p></li>
<li>
<p>Outside account environment - <strong>SEO practices such as use lists of=
 negative keywords </strong>to exclude vulnerable groups&nbsp; (minors/18-2=
4/high risk/self-excluded players)</p></li>
<li>
<p>Regulator suggests to operators only to work with affiliates who have hi=
storical (retroactive) data showing they are targetting 24+ year olds.</p><=
